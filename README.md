# Code Refactor Starter Code
Challenge #1

NOTES:

CSS:
-Added a media query so it can extend the display box with the content classes inside so the text will fit
-Set a greater height for the header and set the ul element to flex row so they stay in their desired line
-Lastly I made the text of benefit class titles smaller to be able to fit smaller screens 
-The last media queries are set there to hide the images of the contents because they dont fit smaller screens

HTML:
-Made the title unique 
-Added a li and divs and href for User Benefits so it is easier to naviagate on the website and css
-added alt attributes to all the images and added the correct alt attribute
